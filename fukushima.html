            <h3>Media Analysis: Representation of the Fukushima Water Incident</h3> 
            <p>July 2023</p>
            <p>
                Japan's recently announced plans to release treated wastewater from its Fukushima Nuclear Plant back to the ocean has created controversy globally.
                 In this project, I produced preliminary findings on how Western, Chinese, and Japanese news sources differed in their representations of the incident.

            <p>
                After collecting news articles in Lexis-Nexis, I created a program in Python to scrape each of the articles to collect 
                the article's title, media source, date, text, and keywords and to write this data into a CSV file. The media sources were
                sorted into four categories: Chinese media, Japanese media, Western media, and other media.
                Next, I created vizualizations of the data to answer the following questions:

            <br>
            <ol class="image-filter-through">
                <li>
                    <p>Per month, how frequently were media sources covering the Fukushima water incident?</p>

                    frequency of articles per month separated by media source">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>How frequently were media sources discussing the environment or politics when covering the Fukushima water incident?</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What proportion of articles covering the Fukushima water incident discussed the environment or politics?</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Using unsupervised machine learning, what topics were frequently mentioned together?</p>

                Reflection: <br>
                This project allowed me to further systematize the data scraping program I developed for my first Research Assistant
                project so that it could be applied to any set of RTF collection. In addition, I got more involved with the media analysis aspect of my professor's
                work as we investigated how a politically-charged event was covered differently around the world.
